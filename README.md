# vim.orion

An out of box neovim experience designed to be your endgame. Lightweight, minimalistic, functional, and worthy of unixporn.

## General Overview
This configuration ships requiring some dependencies, which I don't even remember right now. There's also a setup file you need to use, but I forgot where I put it. I'll upload
those soon, after AP testing. In the meantime, feel free to gawk at my shitty code.

## Documentation?
nah
